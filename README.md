### ***Title*** : LAB3
### ***Aim*** : 

(1) Write a program to demonstrate pointers.Declare a pointer ptr to integer and equate it to address of integer i. Print value of i,value of &i,value of ptr and value of *ptr.

(2) Write a program in C to demonstrate function call by value and call by reference by writing a swap function to swap two integers.

### ***Algorithm*** :

(1) :

   (i) Initialize a variable i and pointer
   
   (ii) print the value of i and & of i
   
   (iii) give the address of i to pointer
   
   (iv) print the address which pointer contains and get the value at that address.

(2) : 

   (i) write the declaration of function
   
   (ii) write the defination of function

   (iii) write the function call in main

   (iv) calling of function can be of 2 types call by value and call by reference

### ***Explanation*** :

(1) : 

   (i) Initailize i to a value and print it using printf()

   (ii) print the value of i and address at which value of i is present using printf()

   (iii) give the address of i to pointer

   (iv) pointer will point at that address and picks the value at that address and store in a variable

(2) :

   (i) declaration should be given before main function 

   (ii) defination contains the actual logic based on the given arguments

   (iii) function needs to be called by value or by reference in main
